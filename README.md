# esp_mkr_fastapi_ollama
This repo contains the codes about calling FastAPI web server running Ollama for responding back to the prompt served by ESP8266, ESP32 and Arduino MKR 1000

# Keep both Raspberry Pi 4B and generic ESP8266 on same network. It is better to use Mobile Hotspot as Wi-FI mediator for both

1. The fastapisever.py must be run firstly
2. Run the esp8266ollama.ino code next

Server <--------------> Mobile Hotspot <--------------> Esp8266 client

# Run ipconfig (windows), ifconfig(linux) to know about the IP address of Server. Check the  IPv4 Address.

Client sends a prompt to Server (ollama API) on fastapi
Server (ollama API) on fastapi responds json object back to Client

Server <-------------Client (esp8266)
Server -------------> Client (esp8266)

Server <-------------Client (esp32)
Server ------------->Client (esp32)

Server <-------------Client (mkr1000)
Server ------------->Client (mkr1000)

# Run same version codes together as we updated the version of both the systems

# Conduct tests using all 18 prompts in sequential manner by changing the BAUD RATE (9600, 57600, 115200) of the Module. 

Record the results into one excel sheet. 

# Below are Test Codes for this study

* esp8266ollama_test.ino
* esp32ollama_test.ino
* mkr1000ollama_test.ino

# Change the LLM (qwen2:0.5b) for each baud rate for above.
